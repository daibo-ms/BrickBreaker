# BrickBreaker
## This game code is completely developed by DeepSeek without any code change by human
## I provided guidance to develop the codes step by step:
## 1. At beginning give general description of the game idea to DeepSeek
## 2. Run code generated by DeepSeek and provide feedback to DeepSeek, 
##     including error report and improvement suggestions
## In total it took about 8 hours to complete the game
